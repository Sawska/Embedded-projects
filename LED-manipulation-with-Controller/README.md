### ðŸ“˜ `LED-manipulation-with-Controller`

**Board:** ESP32
**Peripherals:** Joystick Module, RGB or individual LEDs
**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Joystick interfacing via ADC
* LED control logic (position, color, pattern)
* Modular design for reusable code

**Description:**
A collection of projects focused on manipulating LEDs using a joystick. The joystick acts as the main controller to move LED positions, adjust brightness, or toggle lighting patterns. Ideal for practicing fine-grained analog input handling and LED output control.
