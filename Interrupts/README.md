**Project:** **Reaction Timer Game**  
Measure how fast you can press a button after an LED lights up using external interrupts.

**BOM:**

- Arduino UNO
    
- Push button
    
- LED + resistor
    

**Implementation:**

- Use an **external interrupt** to detect button press.
    
- Start timer when LED turns on.
    
- Stop timer when button interrupt fires.
    

**Skills learned:**

- External interrupts
    
- ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) best practices
    
- Debouncing in interrupts
