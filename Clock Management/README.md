**Project:**Â **Low-Power Clock Switching**  
Switch between high-speed and low-speed clocks to save power in an ESP32 sensor project.

**BOM:**

- ESP32
    
- DHT22 sensor
    

**Implementation:**

- Use high-speed clock during sensor read.
    
- Switch to low-speed clock during idle.
    

**Skills learned:**

- Understanding MCU clock sources
    
- Balancing speed vs. power consumption
