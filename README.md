## 📋 Featured Projects

* 🎯 **Motion-Activated Devices**
  Detect motion using PIR sensors to trigger events such as lighting, sound, or alarms.

* 🎨 **LED Control with Input Devices**
  Manipulate RGB or single-color LEDs using controllers like joysticks, buttons, or potentiometers.

* 🌡️ **Temperature & Humidity Monitor**
  Display real-time environmental data using sensors (e.g., DHT11/DHT22) on an OLED screen.

* ⏰ **RTC Alarm System with LCD & Relay**
  Build a functional clock using an RTC module, set alarms, and control devices via relays and LCD output.
