# ‚è∞ Real-Time Clock Alarm with LCD & Relay Control

**üß∞ Board:** Raspberry Pi Pico / Arduino Uno
**üì¶ Modules:** DS3231 RTC Module, 16x2 LCD Display (I2C), Relay Module, Buzzer, Push Buttons
**üí° Skills Demonstrated:**

* I2C communication with RTC and LCD
* Real-time clock synchronization
* Relay module control for switching external devices
* Buzzer activation for audible alarms
* Button-based user interface for setting time and alarms

**üìñ Project Description:**
This project allows you to display and manage the current time and an alarm time using a DS3231 RTC module and a 16x2 LCD. Users can set the time and alarm using push buttons. When the alarm time is reached, a relay is activated (to control a device like a lamp or fan), and a buzzer is triggered for sound notification.
