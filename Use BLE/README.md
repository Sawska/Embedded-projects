# ðŸ“¡ Use BLE â€“ Gas Sensor Beacon

**Project:** *BLE Gas Sensor Beacon*

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Learn how to broadcast **gas sensor data** over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** using the ESP32, making it visible to smartphones or other BLEâ€‘enabled devices.

---

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project demonstrates how to:

* Use the **ESP32â€™s builtâ€‘in BLE** to read an analog **MQâ€‘series gas sensor**.
* Advertise the gas level in a **BLE GATT service** so it can be viewed on a phone.
* Monitor the sensor in real time using apps like **nRF Connect** (iOS/Android).

While the original concept was for a *BLE Temperature Beacon*, this version replaces the temperature sensor with a **gas sensor** for air quality monitoring.

---

## ðŸ›  Features

* Reads gas level from **analog pin**.
* Sends updated readings every **2 seconds** via BLE notifications.
* Can be viewed in **nRF Connect** without complex pairing.

---

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn

* **BLE advertising** vs **GATT services**.
* Broadcasting sensor data without pairing.
* Reading BLE data from a phone in real time.
